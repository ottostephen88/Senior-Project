# Senior-Project
My senior project involved created a soft robotic fish capable of swimming autonoumously. I specifically worked on the electronics, programming, and design of the actuaction for the project. A GUI was created using Visual Studio C#, allowing it to communication with Arduino using the serial port. The final report shows everything the group worked on for the project.
