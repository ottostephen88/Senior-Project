# Senior-Project
My senior project involved created a soft robotic fish capable of swimming autonoumously. I specifically worked on the electronics, programming, and design for the project. I worked on the actuation of the fish. A GUI was created using Visual Studio C# and communication with Arduino using the serial port.
